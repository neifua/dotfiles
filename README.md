# Neifua's niri Dotfiles

This repo is my personal [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) dotfiles. I use niri because of the scrollable-tiling feature and I love the hell outta it, Wayland kinda sucks but who cares 🤷.

## Notes

- This setup is designed for my personal use, but feel free to clone and use, explore or fork.
